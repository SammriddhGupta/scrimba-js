# Scrimba JS course 

This is just code done in scrimba's javascript course.

I might add features and make it better in the future if I get time!

Note that I do not follow good practices for commit messages and stuff here because all this is directly committed at the end after having done it interactively on scrimba's website, I do know good git practices :D
